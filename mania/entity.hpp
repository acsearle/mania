    // MCU has a 'microstate' that allows it to perform operations over multiple

    // the cell ahead to clear before it can move on.  It can also be used to
    // wait for conditions to be met (input cell nonzero, output cell zero)
    // that can be used to construct locks, barriers, wait_load, wait_store.
    // Never use the microstate to smuggle information between cells; this is
    // what the registers are for, and nonzero values have different meanings
    // in different cells / instructions anyway.  The microstate is always
    // zero when entering and leaving a new cell.  Without the microstate, the
    // MCU would always attempt to execute the whole instructon each cycle while
    // blocked.  This is not always desired.

    // Operations may wait for some conditions to be met, mutate their own state
    // and that of the world, and then wait for more conditions to be met before
    // moving on.  For example, a LOCK instruction waits until a cell is zero,
    // then writes one to it, then proceeds.  A BARRIER instruction decrements
    // a cell, then waits until the cell is zero, then proceeds.
    
    // If MCUs are physical, the operations must also reserve and release cells
    // as they travel through them.  On execution, if state is zero, release
    // the "from" cell indicated by D, perform instruction, then if not
    // waiting, acquire the "to" cell indicated by D.
    
    // MCU has multiple registers.  These let it carry state as it moves around
    //     A:  The accumulator register.  Instructions involving two locations
    //         usually include accumulator as one of them.  For example,
    //         addition is perfromed by adding a value from a memory cell or
    //         register to the accumulator, A = A + *addr
    //     B:  General-purpose register
    //     C:  General-purpose register
    //     D:  The direction register.  The last two bits control the direction
    //         the MCU is travelling (0123 -> NESW).  Conditional instructions
    //         like "<" write their output to the direction register, as in
    //         right-turn-if-less-than D += (A < *addr)

    // Each tick, the MCU reads its instruction from the cell it is "at".  The
    // instruction may address only the diagonally adjacent cells for read write
    // etc.
    //
    // Code and data are mingled together, but diagonal access means it is easy
    // to keep them locally separate on two complementary grids.
